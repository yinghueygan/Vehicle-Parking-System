# Vehicle-Parking-System
A user-friendly vehicle parking system is developed with Java. This system can safely and accurately manage the parking slots. The primary user of this system is the administrator. To access to the system, an administrator needs to login using a predefined account and password. Users can perform several actions, and these include viewing the parking slot, assigning the parking as well as freeing up the parking slot. All the related information will be stored in a text file and can be retrieved as well as manipulated in future. When a parking slot is freed, our system will also calculate and display the corresponding parking fee automatically. 

## To access the system, please use:
user ID: admin; password: 123456
